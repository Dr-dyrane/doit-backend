## Description

The Doit Backend is the server-side component of the Doit app. It provides the necessary API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. The backend also handles data storage and retrieval using MongoDB.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

## Getting Started

To get started with the Doit Backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dr-dyrane/doit-backend.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd doit-backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your MongoDB database and update the database connection details in the `config/database.js` file.

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The backend API should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:your-port`. You can integrate it with the Doit frontend or any other client application.

## Features

Here's a high-level overview of what you can consider doing next:

1. **Set Up Node.js and Express.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your development machine. You can check this by running `node -v` in your terminal. If Node.js is not installed, download it from the official website. You'll also need to install Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js, to build your backend.

2. **Create the Backend Structure**: Organize your backend code by creating folders for routes, controllers, models, and other components. This will help you maintain a clean project structure.

3. **Define Routes**: Define the API routes for your backend. For example, you might have routes for creating tasks, updating tasks, deleting tasks, and fetching tasks from the database.

4. **Database Setup**: Since you mentioned MongoDB, you'll need to set up a MongoDB database for storing task data. You can use a service like MongoDB Atlas for cloud-hosted MongoDB or set up a local MongoDB server.

5. **Create Models**: Define Mongoose models for your tasks. Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and allows you to create schemas for your data.

6. **Implement Controllers**: Create controllers for handling the logic of your API routes. These controllers will interact with the database using the Mongoose models.

7. **Add Validation**: Implement input validation and error handling to ensure that your API endpoints handle requests correctly.

8. **Connect to the Database**: Set up the connection to your MongoDB database in your backend code. Use environment variables to securely store sensitive information like database credentials.

9. **Testing**: Write tests for your backend API routes and controllers to ensure that everything is working as expected.

10. **Deployment**: Choose a platform to deploy your backend. Common choices include services like Heroku, Vercel, Netlify (for serverless functions), or a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

11. **CORS Configuration**: Ensure that your backend allows Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests from your frontend domain. This is important for your frontend to communicate with the backend API.

12. **Authentication and Authorization (Future Feature)**: If you plan to implement user authentication and authorization, consider adding this feature. You can use packages like Passport.js for authentication.

13. **Documentation**: Document your API endpoints using tools like Swagger or write clear API documentation in your README.

14. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing and deployment of your backend code.

15. **Monitoring and Logging (Optional)**: Implement monitoring and logging solutions to track the performance and errors of your backend application.

16. **Security**: Pay attention to security best practices, including protecting against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

17. **Scaling (Future Consideration)**: As your app grows, consider strategies for scaling your backend to handle increased traffic.

## API Routes

Here are the main API routes provided by the backend:

- `GET /api/tasks`: Get a list of all tasks.
- `POST /api/tasks`: Create a new task.
- `GET /api/tasks/:id`: Get a specific task by ID.
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id`: Update a specific task by ID.
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id`: Delete a specific task by ID.

You can find detailed API documentation in the `docs/` folder.

## Database

The Doit Backend uses MongoDB for data storage. You can access the database at [Doit MongoDB Database](https://doit-by-dyrane-db.netlify.app). Update the database configuration in the `config/database.js` file.
